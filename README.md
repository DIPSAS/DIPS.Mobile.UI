# DIPS.Mobile Component Library
To support developers building DIPS mobile native apps, the designers maintain a Design System with style resources and components to use. The components are available for the developers by using DIPS.Mobile.UI as a dependency for their app. 

This project is well documented with examples on how to use the components from DIPS. The documentation can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/DIPSAS/DIPS.Mobile.UI/wiki) section.

## Design Tokens
The style resources in this library is generated in [DIPS.Mobile.DesignTokens](https://github.com/DIPSAS/DIPS.Mobile.DesignTokens), which is exported from the Design System. These resources are available for you in .NET Standard, Android and iOS project by xaml/xml resources or APIs.

## Platform support
This library supports Android and iOS. UWP / WPF for desktop is supported by a internal components library in DIPS.

## MAUI support
This project is still a Xamarin project, but will transition to MAUI once the timing is right for DIPS.
