# DIPS.Mobile Component Library
To support developers building DIPS mobile native apps, the designers maintain a Design System with style resources and components to use. The components are available for the developers by using DIPS.Mobile.UI as a dependency for their app. This project is well documented with examples on how to use the components from DIPS.

## Platform support
This library supports Android and iOS. UWP / WPF for desktop is supported by a internal components library in DIPS.

## MAUI support
This project is still a Xamarin project, but will transition to MAUI once the timing is right for DIPS.
